# Nuit de l'info 2021

"Nuit de l'info" is a nationnal coding competition held every year during the first week of December. The aim is to develop a web based application overnight that meets specifications set by the organisers. There is also the possibility to complete up to five side-challenges to add some fun to the evening (eg : hiding an easter egg, adding a dark theme).

This repository contains the codebase of our team's participation (Go UPSSISOMNIACS !)
